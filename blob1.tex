\medskip

\noindent
{\bf Warning:} This draft is draftier than you might expect.
More specifically,
\begin{itemize}
\item Some sections are missing.
\item Many sections are incomplete.
In some cases the incompleteness is noted, in some cases not.
\item Some sections have been rewritten, but the older, obsolete version of
the section has not been deleted yet.
\item Some sections were written nearly two years ago, and are now outdated.
\item Some sections have not been proof-read.
\item There are not yet enough citations to similar work of other people.
\item Due to multiple authors and multiple, disconnected episodes of writing,
the various parts do not cohere as well as they should. 
\end{itemize}
Despite all this, there's probably enough decipherable material
here to interest the motivated reader.
On the other hand, if you are only going to read this paper once,
{\bf then don't read this version,} as a more complete version will be available in a couple of months.
