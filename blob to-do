* add "homeomorphism" spiel befure the first use of "homeomorphism in the intro
* maybe also additional homeo warnings in other sections

* Lemma 3.2.3 (\ref{support-shrink}) implicitly assumes embedded (non-self-intersecting) blobs. this can be fixed, of course, but it makes the argument more difficult to understand

* Maybe give more details in 6.7.2


====== minor/optional ======

[probably NO] * consider proving the gluing formula for higher codimension manifolds with
morita equivalence

[probably NO] * leftover: we used to require that composition of A-infinity n-morphisms was injective (just like lower morphisms).  Should we stick this back in?  I don't think we use it anywhere.

* should we require, for A-inf n-cats, that families which preserve product morphisms act trivially?  as now defined, this is only true up to homotopy for the blob complex, so maybe best not to open that can of worms
(but since the strict version of this is true for BT_*, maybe we're OK)

* figures
(** 13 "combining two balls" is lame) (but maybe leave it as is -- KW)


* better discussion of systems of fields from disk-like n-cats
*** Is this done by now?
 
* make sure we are clear that boundary = germ
*** perhaps we are already clear enough
   
* framings and duality -- work out what's going on! (alternatively, vague-ify current statement)
*** is the new version sufficiently vague?

(for reference:
	* places splitting axiom is used:
	** in the proof that gluing in dimension < n is injective
	** in the proof that D(a) is acyclic
	** in the small blobs lemma
)
