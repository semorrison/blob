====== big ======

* need to change module axioms to follow changes in n-cat axioms; search for and destroy all the "Homeo_\bd"'s, add a v-cone axiom

* probably should go through and refer to new splitting axiom when we need to choose refinements etc.


* framings and duality -- work out what's going on! (alternatively, vague-ify current statement)

* make sure we are clear that boundary = germ (perhaps we are already clear enough)



====== minor/optional ======

* consider proving the gluing formula for higher codimension manifolds with
morita equivalence

* leftover: we used to require that composition of A-infinity n-morphisms was injective (just like lower morphisms).  Should we stick this back in?  I don't think we use it anywhere.

* should we require, for A-inf n-cats, that families which preserve product morphisms act trivially?  as now defined, this is only true up to homotopy for the blob complex, so maybe best not to open that can of worms
(but since the strict version of this is true for BT_*, maybe we're OK)

* review colors in figures


====== Scott ======

* SCOTT will go through appendix C.2 and make it better

* SCOTT: typo in delfig3a -- upper g should be g^{-1}

* SCOTT: make sure acknowledge list doesn't omit anyone from blob seminar who should be included (I think I have all the speakers; does anyone other than the speakers rate a mention?)

* SCOTT: figure for example 3.1.2 (sin 1/z)

* SCOTT: add vertical arrow to middle of figure 19 (decomp poset)

* SCOTT: review/proof-read recent KW changes, especially colimit section and n-cat axioms
