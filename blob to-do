* lemma [inject  6.3.5?] assumes more splittablity than the axioms imply (?)

* need to change module axioms to follow changes in n-cat axioms; search for and destroy all the "Homeo_\bd"'s


* Boundary of colimit -- not so easy to see!

* ** new material in colimit section needs a proof-read


* should probably allow product things \pi^*(b) to be defined only when b is appropriately splittable

* framings and duality -- work out what's going on! (alternatively, vague-ify current statement)

* make sure we are clear that boundary = germ

* go through text and remove any disclaimers about continuous (as oppsed to PL) homeos

* review colors in figures

* maybe say something in colimit section about restriction to submanifolds and submanifolds of boundary (we use this in n-cat axioms)


* ? define Morita equivalence?

* consider proving the gluing formula for higher codimension manifolds with
morita equivalence

* leftover: we used to require that composition of A-infinity n-morphisms was injective (just like lower morphisms).  Should we stick this back in?  I don't think we use it anywhere.

* should we require, for A-inf n-cats, that families which preserve product morphisms act trivially?  as now defined, this is only true up to homotopy for the blob complex, so maybe best not to open that can of worms



* SCOTT will go through appendix C.2 and make it better

* SCOTT: typo in delfig3a -- upper g should be g^{-1}

* SCOTT: make sure acknowledge list doesn't omit anyone from blob seminar who should be included (I think I have all the speakers; does anyone other than the speakers rate a mention?)

* SCOTT: figure for example 3.1.2 (sin 1/z)

* SCOTT: add vertical arrow to middle of figure 19 (decomp poset)

* SCOTT: review/proof-read recent KW changes
