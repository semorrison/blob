====== big ======

* better discussion of systems of fields from disk-like n-cats
    (Is this done by now?)
    
* ?? say clearly that certain lemmas don't work for TOP; we're only claiming DIFF and PL (requires small changes in many places)

* need to fix fam-o-homeo argument per discussion with Rob (or just remove it)

* need to change module axioms to follow changes in n-cat axioms; search for and destroy all the "Homeo_\bd"'s, add a v-cone axiom

* probably should go through and refer to new splitting axiom when we need to choose refinements etc.
** in the proof that gluing in dimension < n is injective

* framings and duality -- work out what's going on! (alternatively, vague-ify current statement)

* make sure we are clear that boundary = germ (perhaps we are already clear enough)



====== minor/optional ======

* consider proving the gluing formula for higher codimension manifolds with
morita equivalence

* leftover: we used to require that composition of A-infinity n-morphisms was injective (just like lower morphisms).  Should we stick this back in?  I don't think we use it anywhere.

* should we require, for A-inf n-cats, that families which preserve product morphisms act trivially?  as now defined, this is only true up to homotopy for the blob complex, so maybe best not to open that can of worms
(but since the strict version of this is true for BT_*, maybe we're OK)

* review colors in figures


====== Scott ======

* SCOTT will go through appendix C.2 and make it better

* SCOTT: review/proof-read recent KW changes, especially colimit section and n-cat axioms
