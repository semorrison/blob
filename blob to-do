* We need to be clearer about which types of homeomorphisms the
"localization" theorem in the appendix works for, in the body of the
paper. Options here include:
a) having a better theorem in a separate paper, so we don't actually
need to worry 
[** currently working on this option]
b) changing the statements in the paper, for example writing PL-Homeo
everywhere instead of Homeo
c) explicitly saying "Homeo means PL-Homeo" everywhere
c') if we succumb to Peter's suggestion of say "Iso" everywhere,
perhaps we could adopt the notation that "Iso^*" or similar means one
of a restricted set of categories, where the appendix works, and using
this notation in section 5.

* Consider moving A_\infty stuff to a subsection

* dimension n+1, explain the statement and refer to KW's notes

* framings and duality -- work out what's going on!

* consider proving the gluing formula for higher codimension manifolds with
morita equivalence


* Peter's suggestion for A_inf definition

* enriching in other \infty categories, explaining how "D" should
interact with coproducts in "S" (break out A_\infty stuff into a
subsection)


* SCOTT will go through appendix C.2 and make it better

* In the appendix on n=1, explain more about orientations. Also say
what happens on objects for spin manifolds: the unique point has an
automorphism, which translates into a involution on objects. Mention
super-stuff.

* make remarks about defect interpretation of sphere modules


colimit subsection: 

* Labeling of the k-1 skeleton agreeing on the k-2 skeleton is awfully vague. 

* Category of permissible decompositions must be a small category in order to take the colimit. 

* Boundary of \cl; not so easy to see!


modules:

* Marked hemispheres, need better language.

* Lemma 6.4.5 needs to actually construct this map! Needs more input! Do
we actually need this as written?



* add remark about relation of SC operad to Ryan Budney thing

* SCOTT: typo in delfig3a -- upper g should be g^{-1}

* finalize acknowledge list

* fix "cell decomposition" (\nn remark) in string-diagram-fields def
