\dropcap{T}he aim of this paper is to describe a derived category analogue of topological quantum field theories.

For our purposes, an $n{+}1$-dimensional TQFT is a locally defined system of
invariants of manifolds of dimensions 0 through $n+1$. In particular,
the TQFT invariant $A(Y)$ of a closed $k$-manifold $Y$ is a linear $(n{-}k)$-category.
If $Y$ has boundary then $A(Y)$ is a collection of $(n{-}k)$-categories which afford
a representation of the $(n{-}k{+}1)$-category $A(\bd Y)$.
(See \cite{1009.5025} and \cite{kw:tqft};
for a more homotopy-theoretic point of view see \cite{0905.0465}.)

We now comment on some particular values of $k$ above.
A linear 0-category is a vector space, and a representation
of a vector space is an element of the dual space.
Thus a TQFT assigns to each closed $n$-manifold $Y$ a vector space $A(Y)$,
and to each $(n{+}1)$-manifold $W$ an element of $A(\bd W)^*$.
For the remainder of this paper we will in fact be interested in so-called $(n{+}\epsilon)$-dimensional
TQFTs, which are slightly weaker structures and do not assign anything to general $(n{+}1)$-manifolds, but only to mapping cylinders.

When $k=n-1$ we have a linear 1-category $A(S)$ for each $(n{-}1)$-manifold $S$,
and a representation of $A(\bd Y)$ for each $n$-manifold $Y$.
The TQFT gluing rule in dimension $n$ states that
$A(Y_1\cup_S Y_2) \cong A(Y_1) \ot_{A(S)} A(Y_2)$,
where $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ and $n$-manifolds with common boundary $S$.

When $k=0$ we have an $n$-category $A(pt)$.
This can be thought of as the local part of the TQFT, and the full TQFT can be reconstructed from $A(pt)$
via colimits (see below).

We call a TQFT semisimple if $A(S)$ is a semisimple 1-category for all $(n{-}1)$-manifolds $S$
and $A(Y)$ is a finite-dimensional vector space for all $n$-manifolds $Y$.
Examples of semisimple TQFTs include Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev theories, 
Turaev-Viro theories, and Dijkgraaf-Witten theories.
These can all be given satisfactory accounts in the framework outlined above.
(The WRT invariants need to be reinterpreted as $3{+}1$-dimensional theories with only a weak dependence on interiors in order to be
extended all the way down to dimension 0.)

For other non-semisimple TQFT-like invariants, however, the above framework seems to be inadequate.
For example, the gluing rule for 3-manifolds in Ozsv\'{a}th-Szab\'{o}/Seiberg-Witten theory
involves a tensor product over an $A_\infty$ 1-category associated to 2-manifolds \cite{1003.0598,1005.1248}.
Long exact sequences are important computational tools in these theories,
and also in Khovanov homology, but the colimit construction breaks exactness.
For these reasons and others, it is desirable to 
extend to above framework to incorporate ideas from derived categories.

One approach to such a generalization might be to simply define a
TQFT via its gluing formulas, replacing tensor products with
derived tensor products (c.f. \cite{1011.1958}).
However, it is probably difficult to prove
the invariance of such a definition, as the object associated to a manifold
will a priori depend on the explicit presentation used to apply the gluing formulas.
We instead give a manifestly invariant construction, and
deduce from it the gluing formulas based on $A_\infty$ tensor products.

This paper is organized as follows.
We first give an account of our version of $n$-categories.
According to our definition, $n$-categories are, among other things,
functorial invariants of $k$-balls, $0\le k \le n$, which behave well with respect to gluing.
We then show how to extend an $n$-category from balls to arbitrary $k$-manifolds,
using colimits and homotopy colimits.
This extension, which we call the blob complex, has as $0$-th homology the usual TQFT invariant.
(The name comes from the ``blobs" which feature prominently
in a concrete version of the homotopy colimit.)
We then review some basic properties of the blob complex, and finish by showing how it
yields a higher categorical and higher dimensional generalization of Deligne's
conjecture on Hochschild cochains and the little 2-disks operad.

\nn{maybe this is not necessary?} \nn{let's move this to somewhere later, if we keep it}
In an attempt to forestall any confusion that might arise from different definitions of 
``$n$-category" and ``TQFT", we note that our $n$-categories are both more and less general
than the ``fully dualizable" ones which play a prominent role in \cite{0905.0465}.
More general in that we make no duality assumptions in the top dimension $n+1$.
Less general in that we impose stronger duality requirements in dimensions 0 through $n$.
Thus our $n$-categories correspond to $(n{+}\epsilon)$-dimensional unoriented or oriented TQFTs, while
Lurie's (fully dualizable) $n$-categories correspond to $(n{+}1)$-dimensional framed TQFTs.

At several points we only sketch an argument briefly; full details can be found in \cite{1009.5025}. In this paper we attempt to give a clear view of the big picture without getting bogged down in technical details.


\section{Definitions}
\subsection{$n$-categories} \mbox{}

In this section we give a definition of $n$-categories designed to work well with TQFTs.
The main idea is to base the definition on actual balls, rather combinatorial models of them.
This has the advantages of avoiding a proliferation of coherency axioms and building in a strong
version of duality from the start.


%\nn{maybe say something about goals: well-suited to TQFTs; avoid proliferation of coherency axioms;
%non-recursive (n-cats not defined n terms of (n-1)-cats; easy to show that the motivating
%examples satisfy the axioms; strong duality; both plain and infty case;
%(?) easy to see that axioms are correct, in the sense of nothing missing (need
%to say this better if we keep it)}
%
%\nn{maybe: the typical n-cat definition tries to do two things at once: (1) give a list of basic properties
%which are weak enough to include the basic examples and strong enough to support the proofs
%of the main theorems; and (2) specify a minimal set of generators and/or axioms.
%We separate these two tasks, and address only the first, which becomes much easier when not burdened by the second.
%More specifically, life is easier when working with maximal, rather than minimal, collections of axioms.}

We will define plain and $A_\infty$ $n$-categories simultaneously, as all but one of the axioms are identical
in the two cases.


There are five basic ingredients 
\cite{life-of-brian} of an $n$-category definition:
$k$-morphisms (for $0\le k \le n$), domain and range, composition,
identity morphisms, and special behavior in dimension $n$ (e.g. enrichment
in some auxiliary category, or strict associativity instead of weak associativity).
We will treat each of these in turn.

To motivate our morphism axiom, consider the venerable notion of the Moore loop space
\cite[\S 2.2]{MR505692}.
In the standard definition of a loop space, loops are always parameterized by the unit interval $I = [0,1]$,
so composition of loops requires a reparameterization $I\cup I \cong I$, and this leads to a proliferation
of higher associativity relations.
While this proliferation is manageable for 1-categories (and indeed leads to an elegant theory
of Stasheff polyhedra and $A_\infty$ categories), it becomes undesirably complex for higher categories.
In a Moore loop space, we have a separate space $\Omega_r$ for each interval $[0,r]$, and a 
{\it strictly associative} composition $\Omega_r\times \Omega_s\to \Omega_{r+s}$.
Thus we can have the simplicity of strict associativity in exchange for more morphisms.
We wish to imitate this strategy in higher categories.
Because we are mainly interested in the case of strong duality, we replace the intervals $[0,r]$ not with
a product of $k$ intervals (c.f. \cite{0909.2212}) but rather with any $k$-ball, that is, any $k$-manifold which is homeomorphic
to the standard $k$-ball $B^k$.
\nn{maybe add that in addition we want functoriality}

By default our balls are oriented,
but it is useful at times to vary this,
for example by considering unoriented or Spin balls.
We can also consider more exotic structures, such as balls with a map to some target space,
or equipped with $m$ independent vector fields.
(The latter structure would model $n$-categories with less duality than we usually assume.)

\begin{axiom}[Morphisms]
\label{axiom:morphisms}
For each $0 \le k \le n$, we have a functor $\cC_k$ from 
the category of $k$-balls and 
homeomorphisms to the category of sets and bijections.
\end{axiom}

Note that the functoriality in the above axiom allows us to operate via
homeomorphisms which are not the identity on the boundary of the $k$-ball.
The action of these homeomorphisms gives the ``strong duality" structure.
As such, we don't subdivide the boundary of a morphism
into domain and range --- the duality operations can convert between domain and range.

Later \nn{make sure this actually happens, or reorganise} we inductively define an extension of the functors $\cC_k$ to functors $\cl{\cC}_k$ from arbitrary manifolds to sets. We need the restriction of these functors to $k$-spheres, for $k<n$, for the next axiom.

\begin{axiom}[Boundaries]\label{nca-boundary}
For each $k$-ball $X$, we have a map of sets $\bd: \cC_k(X)\to \cl{\cC}_{k-1}(\bd X)$.
These maps, for various $X$, comprise a natural transformation of functors.
\end{axiom}

For $c\in \cl{\cC}_{k-1}(\bd X)$ we define $\cC_k(X; c) = \bd^{-1}(c)$.

Many of the examples we are interested in are enriched in some auxiliary category $\cS$
(e.g. vector spaces or rings, or, in the $A_\infty$ case, chain complexes or topological spaces).
This means that in the top dimension $k=n$ the sets $\cC_n(X; c)$ have the structure
of an object of $\cS$, and all of the structure maps of the category (above and below) are
compatible with the $\cS$ structure on $\cC_n(X; c)$.


Given two hemispheres (a `domain' and `range') that agree on the equator, we need to be able to assemble them into a boundary value of the entire sphere.

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:domain-and-range}
Let $S = B_1 \cup_E B_2$, where $S$ is a $k{-}1$-sphere $(1\le k\le n)$,
$B_i$ is a $k{-}1$-ball, and $E = B_1\cap B_2$ is a $k{-}2$-sphere (Figure \ref{blah3}).
Let $\cC(B_1) \times_{\cl{\cC}(E)} \cC(B_2)$ denote the fibered product of the 
two maps $\bd: \cC(B_i)\to \cl{\cC}(E)$.
Then we have an injective map
\[
	\gl_E : \cC(B_1) \times_{\cl{\cC}(E)} \cC(B_2) \into \cl{\cC}(S)
\]
which is natural with respect to the actions of homeomorphisms.
%(When $k=1$ we stipulate that $\cl{\cC}(E)$ is a point, so that the above fibered product
%becomes a normal product.)
\end{lem}

If $\bdy B = S$, we denote $\bdy^{-1}(\im(\gl_E))$ by $\cC(B)_E$.

\begin{axiom}[Gluing]
\label{axiom:composition}
Let $B = B_1 \cup_Y B_2$, where $B$, $B_1$ and $B_2$ are $k$-balls ($0\le k\le n$)
and $Y = B_1\cap B_2$ is a $k{-}1$-ball (Figure \ref{blah5}).
Let $E = \bd Y$, which is a $k{-}2$-sphere.
%Note that each of $B$, $B_1$ and $B_2$ has its boundary split into two $k{-}1$-balls by $E$.
We have restriction maps $\cC(B_i)_E \to \cC(Y)$.
Let $\cC(B_1)_E \times_{\cC(Y)} \cC(B_2)_E$ denote the fibered product of these two maps. 
We have a map
\[
	\gl_Y : \cC(B_1)_E \times_{\cC(Y)} \cC(B_2)_E \to \cC(B)_E
\]
which is natural with respect to the actions of homeomorphisms, and also compatible with restrictions
to the intersection of the boundaries of $B$ and $B_i$.
If $k < n$,
or if $k=n$ and we are in the $A_\infty$ case, 
we require that $\gl_Y$ is injective.
(For $k=n$ in the plain (non-$A_\infty$) case, see below.)
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[Strict associativity] \label{nca-assoc}
The gluing maps above are strictly associative.
Given any decomposition of a ball $B$ into smaller balls
$$\bigsqcup B_i \to B,$$ 
any sequence of gluings (where all the intermediate steps are also disjoint unions of balls) yields the same result.
\end{axiom}
For the next axiom, a \emph{pinched product} is a map locally modeled on a degeneracy map between simplices.
\begin{axiom}[Product (identity) morphisms]
\label{axiom:product}
For each pinched product $\pi:E\to X$, with $X$ a $k$-ball and $E$ a $k{+}m$-ball ($m\ge 1$),
there is a map $\pi^*:\cC(X)\to \cC(E)$.
These maps must be
\begin{enumerate}
\item natural with respect to maps of pinched products,
\item functorial with respect to composition of pinched products, 
\item compatible with gluing and restriction of pinched products.
\end{enumerate}

%%% begin noop %%%
% this was the original list of conditions, which I've replaced with the much terser list above -S
\noop{
These maps must satisfy the following conditions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
If $\pi:E\to X$ and $\pi':E'\to X'$ are pinched products, and
if $f:X\to X'$ and $\tilde{f}:E \to E'$ are maps such that the diagram
\[ \xymatrix{
	E \ar[r]^{\tilde{f}} \ar[d]_{\pi} & E' \ar[d]^{\pi'} \\
	X \ar[r]^{f} & X'
} \]
commutes, then we have 
\[
	\pi'^*\circ f = \tilde{f}\circ \pi^*.
\]
\item
Product morphisms are compatible with gluing.
Let $\pi:E\to X$, $\pi_1:E_1\to X_1$, and $\pi_2:E_2\to X_2$ 
be pinched products with $E = E_1\cup E_2$.
Let $a\in \cC(X)$, and let $a_i$ denote the restriction of $a$ to $X_i\subset X$.
Then 
\[
	\pi^*(a) = \pi_1^*(a_1)\bullet \pi_2^*(a_2) .
\]
\item
Product morphisms are associative.
If $\pi:E\to X$ and $\rho:D\to E$ are pinched products then
\[
	\rho^*\circ\pi^* = (\pi\circ\rho)^* .
\]
\item
Product morphisms are compatible with restriction.
If we have a commutative diagram
\[ \xymatrix{
	D \ar@{^(->}[r] \ar[d]_{\rho} & E \ar[d]^{\pi} \\
	Y \ar@{^(->}[r] & X
} \]
such that $\rho$ and $\pi$ are pinched products, then
\[
	\res_D\circ\pi^* = \rho^*\circ\res_Y .
\]
\end{enumerate}
} %%% end \noop %%%
\end{axiom}

To state the next axiom we need the notion of {\it collar maps} on $k$-morphisms.
Let $X$ be a $k$-ball and $Y\subset\bd X$ be a $(k{-}1)$-ball.
Let $J$ be a 1-ball.
Let $Y\times_p J$ denote $Y\times J$ pinched along $(\bd Y)\times J$.
A collar map is an instance of the composition
\[
	\cC(X) \to \cC(X\cup_Y (Y\times_p J)) \to \cC(X) ,
\]
where the first arrow is gluing with a product morphism on $Y\times_p J$ and
the second is induced by a homeomorphism from $X\cup_Y (Y\times_p J)$ to $X$ which restricts
to the identity on the boundary.


\begin{axiom}[\textup{\textbf{[plain  version]}} Extended isotopy invariance in dimension $n$.]
\label{axiom:extended-isotopies}
Let $X$ be an $n$-ball and $f: X\to X$ be a homeomorphism which restricts
to the identity on $\bd X$ and isotopic (rel boundary) to the identity.
Then $f$ acts trivially on $\cC(X)$.
In addition, collar maps act trivially on $\cC(X)$.
\end{axiom}

\smallskip

For $A_\infty$ $n$-categories, we replace
isotopy invariance with the requirement that families of homeomorphisms act.
For the moment, assume that our $n$-morphisms are enriched over chain complexes.
Let $\Homeo_\bd(X)$ denote homeomorphisms of $X$ which fix $\bd X$ and
$C_*(\Homeo_\bd(X))$ denote the singular chains on this space.


\begin{axiom}[\textup{\textbf{[$A_\infty$ version]}} Families of homeomorphisms act in dimension $n$.]
\label{axiom:families}
For each $n$-ball $X$ and each $c\in \cl{\cC}(\bd X)$ we have a map of chain complexes
\[
	C_*(\Homeo_\bd(X))\tensor \cC(X; c) \to \cC(X; c) .
\]
These action maps are required to be associative up to homotopy,
and also compatible with composition (gluing) in the sense that
a diagram like the one in Theorem \ref{thm:CH} commutes.
\end{axiom}

\subsection{Example (the fundamental $n$-groupoid)}
We will define $\pi_{\le n}(T)$, the fundamental $n$-groupoid of a topological space $T$.
When $X$ is a $k$-ball with $k<n$, define $\pi_{\le n}(T)(X)$
to be the set of continuous maps from $X$ to $T$.
When $X$ is an $n$-ball, define $\pi_{\le n}(T)(X)$ to be homotopy classes (rel boundary) of such maps.
Define boundary restrictions and gluing in the obvious way.
If $\rho:E\to X$ is a pinched product and $f:X\to T$ is a $k$-morphism,
define the product morphism $\rho^*(f)$ to be $f\circ\rho$.

We can also define an $A_\infty$ version $\pi_{\le n}^\infty(T)$ of the fundamental $n$-groupoid.
For $X$ an $n$-ball define $\pi_{\le n}^\infty(T)(X)$ to be the space of all maps from $X$ to $T$
(if we are enriching over spaces) or the singular chains on that space (if we are enriching over chain complexes).


\subsection{Example (string diagrams)}
Fix a `traditional' $n$-category $C$ with strong duality (e.g.\ a pivotal 2-category).
Let $X$ be a $k$-ball and define $\cS_C(X)$ to be the set of $C$ string diagrams drawn on $X$;
that is, certain cell complexes embedded in $X$, with the codimension-$j$ cells labeled by $j$-morphisms of $C$.
If $X$ is an $n$-ball, identify two such string diagrams if they evaluate to the same $n$-morphism of $C$.
Boundary restrictions and gluing are again straightforward to define.
Define product morphisms via product cell decompositions.

\subsection{Example (bordism)}
When $X$ is a $k$-ball with $k<n$, $\Bord^n(X)$ is the set of all $k$-dimensional
submanifolds $W$ in $X\times \bbR^\infty$ which project to $X$ transversely
to $\bd X$.
For an $n$-ball $X$ define $\Bord^n(X)$ to be homeomorphism classes rel boundary of such $n$-dimensional submanifolds.

There is an $A_\infty$ analogue enriched in topological spaces, where at the top level we take all such submanifolds, rather than homeomorphism classes. For each fixed $\bdy W \subset \bdy X \times \bbR^\infty$, we can topologize the set of submanifolds by ambient isotopy rel boundary.

\subsection{The blob complex}
\subsubsection{Decompositions of manifolds}

A \emph{ball decomposition} of $W$ is a 
sequence of gluings $M_0\to M_1\to\cdots\to M_m = W$ such that $M_0$ is a disjoint union of balls
$\du_a X_a$ and each $M_i$ is a manifold.
If $X_a$ is some component of $M_0$, its image in $W$ need not be a ball; $\bd X_a$ may have been glued to itself.
A {\it permissible decomposition} of $W$ is a map
\[
	\coprod_a X_a \to W,
\]
which can be completed to a ball decomposition $\du_a X_a = M_0\to\cdots\to M_m = W$.
A permissible decomposition is weaker than a ball decomposition; we forget the order in which the balls
are glued up to yield $W$, and just require that there is some non-pathological way to do this.

Given permissible decompositions $x = \{X_a\}$ and $y = \{Y_b\}$ of $W$, we say that $x$ is a refinement
of $y$, or write $x \le y$, if there is a ball decomposition $\du_a X_a = M_0\to\cdots\to M_m = W$
with $\du_b Y_b = M_i$ for some $i$.

\begin{defn}
The poset $\cell(W)$ has objects the permissible decompositions of $W$, 
and a unique morphism from $x$ to $y$ if and only if $x$ is a refinement of $y$.
See Figure \ref{partofJfig} for an example.
\end{defn}

This poset in fact has more structure, since we can glue together permissible decompositions of $W_1$ and $W_2$ to obtain a permissible decomposition of $W_1 \sqcup W_2$. 

An $n$-category $\cC$ determines 
a functor $\psi_{\cC;W}$ from $\cell(W)$ to the category of sets 
(possibly with additional structure if $k=n$).
Each $k$-ball $X$ of a decomposition $y$ of $W$ has its boundary decomposed into $k{-}1$-balls,
and there is a subset $\cC(X)\spl \subset \cC(X)$ of morphisms whose boundaries
are splittable along this decomposition.

\begin{defn}
Define the functor $\psi_{\cC;W} : \cell(W) \to \Set$ as follows.
For a decomposition $x = \bigsqcup_a X_a$ in $\cell(W)$, $\psi_{\cC;W}(x)$ is the subset
\begin{equation*}
%\label{eq:psi-C}
	\psi_{\cC;W}(x) \subset \prod_a \cC(X_a)\spl
\end{equation*}
where the restrictions to the various pieces of shared boundaries amongst the cells
$X_a$ all agree (this is a fibered product of all the labels of $n$-cells over the labels of $n-1$-cells). When $k=n$, the `subset' and `product' in the above formula should be interpreted in the appropriate enriching category.
If $x$ is a refinement of $y$, the map $\psi_{\cC;W}(x) \to \psi_{\cC;W}(y)$ is given by the composition maps of $\cC$.
\end{defn}

We will use the term `field on $W$' to refer to a point of this functor,
that is, a permissible decomposition $x$ of $W$ together with an element of $\psi_{\cC;W}(x)$.


\subsubsection{Colimits}
Our definition of an $n$-category is essentially a collection of functors defined on $k$-balls (and homeomorphisms) for $k \leq n$ satisfying certain axioms. It is natural to consider extending such functors to the larger categories of all $k$-manifolds (again, with homeomorphisms). In fact, the axioms stated above explictly require such an extension to $k$-spheres for $k<n$.

The natural construction achieving this is the colimit.
\nn{continue}

\nn{Mention that the axioms for $n$-categories can be stated in terms of decompositions of balls?}

We can now give a straightforward but rather abstract definition of the blob complex of an $n$-manifold $W$
with coefficients in the $n$-category $\cC$ as the homotopy colimit along $\cell(W)$
of the functor $\psi_{\cC; W}$ described above. We write this as $\clh{\cC}(W)$.

An explicit realization of the homotopy colimit is provided by the simplices of the functor $\psi_{\cC; W}$. That is, $$\clh{\cC}(W) = \DirectSum_{\bar{x}} \psi_{\cC; W}(x_0)[m],$$ where $\bar{x} = x_0 \leq \cdots \leq x_m$ is a simplex in $\cell(W)$. The differential acts on $(\bar{x},a)$ (here $a \in \psi_{\cC; W}(x_0)$) as
$$\bdy (\bar{x},a) = (\bar{x}, \bdy a) + (-1)^{\deg a} \left( (d_0 \bar{x}, g(a)) + \sum_{i=1}^m (-1)^i (d_i \bar{x}, a) \right)$$
where $g$ is the gluing map from $x_0$ to $x_1$, and $d_i \bar{x}$ denotes the $i$-th face of the simplex $\bar{x}$.

Alternatively, we can take advantage of the product structure on $\cell(W)$ to realize the homotopy colimit via the cone-product polyhedra in $\cell(W)$. A cone-product polyhedra is obtained from a point by successively taking the cone or taking the product with another cone-product polyhedron. Just as simplices correspond to linear directed graphs, cone-product polyheda correspond to directed trees: taking cone adds a new root before the existing root, and taking product identifies the roots of several trees. The `local homotopy colimit' is then defined according to the same formula as above, but with $\bar{x}$ a cone-product polyhedron in $\cell(W)$. The differential acts on $(\bar{x},a)$ both on $a$ and on $\bar{x}$, applying the appropriate gluing map to $a$ when required.
A Eilenberg-Zilber subdivision argument shows this is the same as the usual realization.

%When $\cC$ is a topological $n$-category,
%the flexibility available in the construction of a homotopy colimit allows
%us to give a much more explicit description of the blob complex which we'll write as $\bc_*(W; \cC)$.
%\todo{either need to explain why this is the same, or significantly rewrite this section}
When $\cC$ is the topological $n$-category based on string diagrams for a traditional
$n$-category $C$,
one can show \cite{1009.5025} that the above two constructions of the homotopy colimit
are equivalent to the more concrete construction which we describe next, and which we denote $\bc_*(W; \cC)$.
Roughly speaking, the generators of $\bc_k(W; \cC)$ are string diagrams on $W$ together with
a configuration of $k$ balls (or ``blobs") in $W$ whose interiors are pairwise disjoint or nested.
The restriction of the string diagram to innermost blobs is required to be ``null" in the sense that
it evaluates to a zero $n$-morphism of $C$.
The next few paragraphs describe this in more detail.

We say a collection of balls $\{B_i\}$ in a manifold $W$ is \emph{permissible}
if there exists a permissible decomposition $M_0\to\cdots\to M_m = W$ such that
each $B_i$ appears as a connected component of one of the $M_j$. Note that this allows the balls to be pairwise either disjoint or nested. Such a collection of balls cuts $W$ into pieces, the connected components of $W \setminus \bigcup \bdy B_i$. These pieces need not be manifolds, but they do automatically have permissible decompositions.

The $k$-blob group $\bc_k(W; \cC)$ is generated by the $k$-blob diagrams. A $k$-blob diagram consists of
\begin{itemize}
\item a permissible collection of $k$ embedded balls, and
\item for each resulting piece of $W$, a field,
\end{itemize}
such that for any innermost blob $B$, the field on $B$ goes to zero under the gluing map from $\cC$. We call such a field a `null field on $B$'.

The differential acts on a $k$-blob diagram by summing over ways to forget one of the $k$ blobs, with alternating signs.

We now spell this out for some small values of $k$. For $k=0$, the $0$-blob group is simply fields on $W$. For $k=1$, a generator consists of a field on $W$ and a ball, such that the restriction of the field to that ball is a null field. The differential simply forgets the ball. Thus we see that $H_0$ of the blob complex is the quotient of fields by fields which are null on some ball.

For $k=2$, we have a two types of generators; they each consists of a field $f$ on $W$, and two balls $B_1$ and $B_2$. In the first case, the balls are disjoint, and $f$ restricted to either of the $B_i$ is a null field. In the second case, the balls are properly nested, say $B_1 \subset B_2$, and $f$ restricted to $B_1$ is null. Note that this implies that $f$ restricted to $B_2$ is also null, by the associativity of the gluing operation. This ensures that the differential is well-defined.

\section{Properties of the blob complex}
\subsection{Formal properties}
\label{sec:properties}
The blob complex enjoys the following list of formal properties. The first three are immediate from the definitions.

\begin{property}[Functoriality]
\label{property:functoriality}%
The blob complex is functorial with respect to homeomorphisms.
That is, 
for a fixed $n$-category $\cC$, the association
\begin{equation*}
X \mapsto \bc_*(X; \cC)
\end{equation*}
is a functor from $n$-manifolds and homeomorphisms between them to chain 
complexes and isomorphisms between them.
\end{property}
As a consequence, there is an action of $\Homeo(X)$ on the chain complex $\bc_*(X; \cC)$; 
this action is extended to all of $C_*(\Homeo(X))$ in Theorem \ref{thm:CH} below.

\begin{property}[Disjoint union]
\label{property:disjoint-union}
The blob complex of a disjoint union is naturally isomorphic to the tensor product of the blob complexes.
\begin{equation*}
\bc_*(X_1 \du X_2) \iso \bc_*(X_1) \tensor \bc_*(X_2)
\end{equation*}
\end{property}

If an $n$-manifold $X$ contains $Y \sqcup Y^\text{op}$ (we allow $Y = \eset$) as a codimension $0$ submanifold of its boundary, 
write $X \bigcup_{Y}\selfarrow$ for the manifold obtained by gluing together $Y$ and $Y^\text{op}$.
\begin{property}[Gluing map]
\label{property:gluing-map}%
%If $X_1$ and $X_2$ are $n$-manifolds, with $Y$ a codimension $0$-submanifold of $\bdy X_1$, and $Y^{\text{op}}$ a codimension $0$-submanifold of $\bdy X_2$, there is a chain map
%\begin{equation*}
%\gl_Y: \bc_*(X_1) \tensor \bc_*(X_2) \to \bc_*(X_1 \cup_Y X_2).
%\end{equation*}
Given a gluing $X \to X \bigcup_{Y}\selfarrow$, there is
a map
\[
	\bc_*(X) \to \bc_*(X \bigcup_{Y}\selfarrow),
\]
natural with respect to homeomorphisms, and associative with respect to iterated gluings.
\end{property}

\begin{property}[Contractibility]
\label{property:contractibility}%
The blob complex on an $n$-ball is contractible in the sense 
that it is homotopic to its $0$-th homology, and this is just the vector space associated to the ball by the $n$-category.
\begin{equation*}
\xymatrix{\bc_*(B^n;\cC) \ar[r]^(0.4){\iso}_(0.4){\text{qi}} & H_0(\bc_*(B^n;\cC)) \ar[r]^(0.6)\iso & \cC(B^n)}
\end{equation*}
\end{property}
%\nn{maybe should say something about the $A_\infty$ case}

\begin{proof}(Sketch)
For $k\ge 1$, the contracting homotopy sends a $k$-blob diagram to the $(k{+}1)$-blob diagram
obtained by adding an outer $(k{+}1)$-st blob consisting of all $B^n$.
For $k=0$ we choose a splitting $s: H_0(\bc_*(B^n)) \to \bc_0(B^n)$ and send 
$x\in \bc_0(B^n)$ to $x - s([x])$, where $[x]$ denotes the image of $x$ in $H_0(\bc_*(B^n))$.
\end{proof}

If $\cC$ is an $A-\infty$ $n$-category then $\bc_*(B^n;\cC)$ is still homotopy equivalent to $\cC(B^n)$,
but this is no longer concentrated in degree zero.

\subsection{Specializations}
\label{sec:specializations}

The blob complex has several important special cases.

\begin{thm}[Skein modules]
\label{thm:skein-modules}
\nn{Plain n-categories only?}
The $0$-th blob homology of $X$ is the usual 
(dual) TQFT Hilbert space (a.k.a.\ skein module) associated to $X$
by $\cC$.
\begin{equation*}
H_0(\bc_*(X;\cC)) \iso A_{\cC}(X)
\end{equation*}
\end{thm}
This follows from the fact that the $0$-th homology of a homotopy colimit is the usual colimit, or directly from the explicit description of the blob complex.

\begin{thm}[Hochschild homology when $X=S^1$]
\label{thm:hochschild}
The blob complex for a $1$-category $\cC$ on the circle is
quasi-isomorphic to the Hochschild complex.
\begin{equation*}
\xymatrix{\bc_*(S^1;\cC) \ar[r]^(0.47){\iso}_(0.47){\text{qi}} & \HC_*(\cC).}
\end{equation*}
\end{thm}
This theorem is established by extending the statement to bimodules as well as categories, then verifying that the universal properties of Hochschild homology also hold for $\bc_*(S^1; -)$.

\begin{thm}[Mapping spaces]
\label{thm:map-recon}
Let $\pi^\infty_{\le n}(T)$ denote the $A_\infty$ $n$-category based on maps 
$B^n \to T$.
(The case $n=1$ is the usual $A_\infty$-category of paths in $T$.)
Then 
$$\bc_*(X; \pi^\infty_{\le n}(T)) \simeq \CM{X}{T}.$$
\end{thm}

This says that we can recover (up to homotopy) the space of maps to $T$ via blob homology from local data. 
Note that there is no restriction on the connectivity of $T$ as there is for the corresponding result in topological chiral homology \cite[Theorem 3.8.6]{0911.0018}. The result was proved in \cite[\S 7.3]{1009.5025}.

\subsection{Structure of the blob complex}
\label{sec:structure}

In the following $\CH{X} = C_*(\Homeo(X))$ is the singular chain complex of the space of homeomorphisms of $X$, fixed on $\bdy X$.

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:CH}\label{thm:evaluation}
There is a chain map
\begin{equation*}
e_X: \CH{X} \tensor \bc_*(X) \to \bc_*(X)
\end{equation*}
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item Restricted to $CH_0(X)$ this is the action of homeomorphisms described in Property \ref{property:functoriality}. 

\item For
any codimension $0$-submanifold $Y \sqcup Y^\text{op} \subset \bdy X$ the following diagram
(using the gluing maps described in Property \ref{property:gluing-map}) commutes (up to homotopy).
\begin{equation*}
\xymatrix@C+0.3cm{
     \CH{X} \tensor \bc_*(X)
        \ar[r]_{e_{X}}  \ar[d]^{\gl^{\Homeo}_Y \tensor \gl_Y}  &
            \bc_*(X) \ar[d]_{\gl_Y} \\
     \CH{X \bigcup_Y \selfarrow} \tensor \bc_*(X \bigcup_Y \selfarrow) \ar[r]_<<<<<<<{e_{(X \bigcup_Y \scalebox{0.5}{\selfarrow})}}    & \bc_*(X \bigcup_Y \selfarrow)
}
\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}

Further, this map is associative, in the sense that the following diagram commutes (up to homotopy).
\begin{equation*}
\xymatrix{
\CH{X} \tensor \CH{X} \tensor \bc_*(X) \ar[r]^<<<<<{\id \tensor e_X} \ar[d]^{\compose \tensor \id} & \CH{X} \tensor \bc_*(X) \ar[d]^{e_X} \\
\CH{X} \tensor \bc_*(X) \ar[r]^{e_X} & \bc_*(X)
}
\end{equation*}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}(Sketch.)
We introduce yet another homotopy equivalent version of
the blob complex, $\cB\cT_*(X)$.
Blob diagrams have a natural topology, which is ignored by $\bc_*(X)$.
In $\cB\cT_*(X)$ we take this topology into account, treating the blob diagrams as something
analogous to a simplicial space (but with cone-product polyhedra replacing simplices).
More specifically, a generator of $\cB\cT_k(X)$ is an $i$-parameter family of $j$-blob diagrams, with $i+j=k$. An essential step in the proof of this equivalence is a result to the effect that a $k$-parameter family of homeomorphism can be localized to at most $k$ small sets.

With this alternate version in hand, it is straightforward to prove the theorem.
The evaluation map $\Homeo(X)\times BD_j(X)\to BD_j(X)$
induces a chain map $\CH{X}\tensor C_*(BD_j(X))\to C_*(BD_j(X))$
and hence a map $e_X: \CH{X} \tensor \cB\cT_*(X) \to \cB\cT_*(X)$.
It is easy to check that $e_X$ thus defined has the desired properties.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:blobs-ainfty}
Let $\cC$ be  a topological $n$-category.
Let $Y$ be an $n{-}k$-manifold. 
There is an $A_\infty$ $k$-category $\bc_*(Y;\cC)$, defined on each $m$-ball $D$, for $0 \leq m < k$, 
to be the set $$\bc_*(Y;\cC)(D) = \cl{\cC}(Y \times D)$$ and on $k$-balls $D$ to be the set 
$$\bc_*(Y;\cC)(D) = \bc_*(Y \times D; \cC).$$ 
(When $m=k$ the subsets with fixed boundary conditions form a chain complex.) 
These sets have the structure of an $A_\infty$ $k$-category, with compositions coming from the gluing map in 
Property \ref{property:gluing-map} and with the action of families of homeomorphisms given in Theorem \ref{thm:evaluation}.
\end{thm}
\begin{rem}
When $Y$ is a point this produces an $A_\infty$ $n$-category from a topological $n$-category, 
which can be thought of as a free resolution.
\end{rem}
This result is described in more detail as Example 6.2.8 of \cite{1009.5025}.

Fix a topological $n$-category $\cC$, which we'll now omit from notation.
Recall that for any $(n-1)$-manifold $Y$, the blob complex $\bc_*(Y)$ is naturally an $A_\infty$ category.

\begin{thm}[Gluing formula]
\label{thm:gluing}
\mbox{}% <-- gets the indenting right
\begin{itemize}
\item For any $n$-manifold $X$, with $Y$ a codimension $0$-submanifold of its boundary, the blob complex of $X$ is naturally an
$A_\infty$ module for $\bc_*(Y)$.

\item The blob complex of a glued manifold $X\bigcup_Y \selfarrow$ is the $A_\infty$ self-tensor product of
$\bc_*(X)$ as an $\bc_*(Y)$-bimodule:
\begin{equation*}
\bc_*(X\bigcup_Y \selfarrow) \simeq \bc_*(X) \Tensor^{A_\infty}_{\mathclap{\bc_*(Y)}} \selfarrow
\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof} (Sketch.)
The $A_\infty$ action of $\bc_*(Y)$ follows from the naturality of the blob complex with respect to gluing
and the $C_*(\Homeo(-))$ action of Theorem \ref{thm:evaluation}.

Let $T_*$ denote the self tensor product of $\bc_*(X)$, which is a homotopy colimit.
There is a tautological map from the 0-simplices of $T_*$ to $\bc_*(X\bigcup_Y \selfarrow)$,
and this map can be extended to a chain map on all of $T_*$ by sending the higher simplices to zero.
Constructing a homotopy inverse to this natural map invloves making various choices, but one can show that the
choices form contractible subcomplexes and apply the acyclic models theorem.
\end{proof}

We next describe the blob complex for product manifolds, in terms of the $A_\infty$ blob complex of the $A_\infty$ $n$-categories constructed as above.

\begin{thm}[Product formula]
\label{thm:product}
Let $W$ be a $k$-manifold and $Y$ be an $n-k$ manifold.
Let $\cC$ be an $n$-category.
Let $\bc_*(Y;\cC)$ be the $A_\infty$ $k$-category associated to $Y$ as above.
Then
\[
	\bc_*(Y\times W; \cC) \simeq \clh{\bc_*(Y;\cC)}(W).
\]
\end{thm}
The statement can be generalized to arbitrary fibre bundles, and indeed to arbitrary maps
(see \cite[\S7.1]{1009.5025}).

\begin{proof} (Sketch.)
The proof is similar to that of the second part of Theorem \ref{thm:gluing}.
There is a natural map from the 0-simplices of $\clh{\bc_*(Y;\cC)}(W)$ to $\bc_*(Y\times W; \cC)$,
given by reinterpreting a decomposition of $W$ labeled by $(n{-}k)$-morphisms of $\bc_*(Y; \cC)$ as a blob 
diagram on $W\times Y$.
This map can be extended to all of $\clh{\bc_*(Y;\cC)}(W)$ by sending higher simplices to zero.

To construct the homotopy inverse of the above map one first shows that
$\bc_*(Y\times W; \cC)$ is homotopy equivalent to the subcomplex generated by blob diagrams which
are small with respect any fixed open cover of $Y\times W$.
For a sufficiently fine open cover the generators of this ``small" blob complex are in the image of the map
of the previous paragraph, and furthermore the preimage in $\clh{\bc_*(Y;\cC)}(W)$ of such small diagrams
lie in contractible subcomplexes.
A standard acyclic models argument now constructs the homotopy inverse.
\end{proof}

%\nn{Theorem \ref{thm:product} is proved in \S \ref{ss:product-formula}, and Theorem \ref{thm:gluing} in \S \ref{sec:gluing}.}

\section{Deligne conjecture for $n$-categories}
\label{sec:applications}

Let $M$ and $N$ be $n$-manifolds with common boundary $E$.
Recall (Theorem \ref{thm:gluing}) that the $A_\infty$ category $A = \bc_*(E)$
acts on $\bc_*(M)$ and $\bc_*(N)$.
Let $\hom_A(\bc_*(M), \bc_*(N))$ denote the chain complex of $A_\infty$ module maps
from $\bc_*(M)$ to $\bc_*(N)$.
Let $R$ be another $n$-manifold with boundary $-E$.
There is a chain map
\[
	\hom_A(\bc_*(M), \bc_*(N)) \ot \bc_*(M) \ot_A \bc_*(R) \to \bc_*(N) \ot_A \bc_*(R) .
\]
We think of this map as being associated to a surgery which cuts $M$ out of $M\cup_E R$ and
replaces it with $N$, yielding $N\cup_E R$.
(This is a more general notion of surgery that usual --- $M$ and $N$ can be any manifolds
which share a common boundary.)
In analogy to Hochschild cochains, we will call elements of $\hom_A(\bc_*(M), \bc_*(N))$ ``blob cochains".

Recall (Theorem \ref{thm:evaluation}) that chains on the space of mapping cylinders also act on the 
blob complex.
An $n$-dimensional surgery cylinder is 
defined to be a sequence of mapping cylinders and surgeries (Figure \ref{delfig2}), 
modulo changing the order of distant surgeries, and conjugating a submanifold not modified in a surgery by a homeomorphism. 
One can associated to this data an $(n{+}1)$-manifold with a foliation by intervals,
and the relations we impose correspond to homeomorphisms of the $(n{+}1)$-manifolds
which preserve the foliation.

Surgery cylinders form an operad, by gluing the outer boundary of one cylinder into an inner boundary of another.

\begin{thm}[Higher dimensional Deligne conjecture]
\label{thm:deligne}
The singular chains of the $n$-dimensional surgery cylinder operad act on blob cochains.
\end{thm}

More specifically, let $M_0, N_0, \ldots, M_k, N_k$ be $n$-manifolds and let $SC^n_{\overline{M}, \overline{N}}$
denote the component of the operad with outer boundary $M_0\cup N_0$ and inner boundaries
$M_1\cup N_1,\ldots, M_k\cup N_k$.
Then there is a collection of chain maps
\begin{multline*}
	C_*(SC^n_{\overline{M}, \overline{N}})\otimes \hom(\bc_*(M_1), \bc_*(N_1))\otimes\cdots \\
		\otimes \hom(\bc_*(M_{k}), \bc_*(N_{k})) \to  \hom(\bc_*(M_0), \bc_*(N_0))
\end{multline*}
which satisfy the operad compatibility conditions.

\begin{proof}
We have already defined the action of mapping cylinders, in Theorem \ref{thm:evaluation}, 
and the action of surgeries is just composition of maps of $A_\infty$-modules. 
We only need to check that the relations of the $n$-SC operad are satisfied. 
This follows from the locality of the action of $\CH{-}$ (i.e., that it is compatible with gluing) and associativity.
\end{proof} 

Consider the special case where $n=1$ and all of the $M_i$'s and $N_i$'s are 1-balls.
We have that $SC^1_{\overline{M}, \overline{N}}$ is homotopy equivalent to the little
disks operad and $\hom(\bc_*(M_i), \bc_*(N_i))$ is homotopy equivalent to Hochschild cochains.
This special case is just the usual Deligne conjecture
(see \cite{hep-th/9403055, MR1328534, MR1805894, MR1805923, MR2064592}).

The general case when $n=1$ goes beyond the original Deligne conjecture, as the $M_i$'s and $N_i$'s
could be disjoint unions of 1-balls and circles, and the surgery cylinders could be high genus surfaces.

If all of the $M_i$'s and $N_i$'s are $n$-balls, then $SC^n_{\overline{M}, \overline{N}}$
contains a copy of the little $(n{+}1)$-balls operad.
Thus the little $(n{+}1)$-balls operad acts on blob cochains of the $n$-ball.
