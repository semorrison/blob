\section{The method of acyclic models}  \label{sec:moam}

Let $F_*$ and $G_*$ be chain complexes.
Assume $F_k$ has a basis $\{x_{kj}\}$
(that is, $F_*$ is free and we have specified a basis).
(In our applications, $\{x_{kj}\}$ will typically be singular $k$-simplices or 
$k$-blob diagrams.)
For each basis element $x_{kj}$ assume we have specified a ``target" $D^{kj}_*\sub G_*$.

We say that a chain map $f:F_*\to G_*$ is {\it compatible} with the above data (basis and targets)
if $f(x_{kj})\in D^{kj}_*$ for all $k$ and $j$.
Let $\Compat(D^\bullet_*)$ denote the subcomplex of maps from $F_*$ to $G_*$
such that the image of each higher homotopy applied to $x_{kj}$ lies in $D^{kj}_*$.

\begin{thm}[Acyclic models]
Suppose 
\begin{itemize}
\item $D^{k-1,l}_* \sub D^{kj}_*$ whenever $x_{k-1,l}$ occurs in $\bd x_{kj}$
with non-zero coefficient;
\item $D^{0j}_0$ is non-empty for all $j$; and
\item $D^{kj}_*$ is $(k{-}1)$-acyclic (i.e.\ $H_{k-1}(D^{kj}_*) = 0$) for all $k,j$ .
\end{itemize}
Then $\Compat(D^\bullet_*)$ is non-empty.
If, in addition,
\begin{itemize}
\item $D^{kj}_*$ is $m$-acyclic for $k\le m \le k+i$ and for all $k,j$,
\end{itemize}
then $\Compat(D^\bullet_*)$ is $i$-connected.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
(Sketch)
This is a standard result; see, for example, \nn{need citations}.

We will build a chain map $f\in \Compat(D^\bullet_*)$ inductively.
Choose $f(x_{0j})\in D^{0j}_0$ for all $j$.
