\section{Basic properties of the blob complex}
\label{sec:basic-properties}

\begin{prop} \label{disjunion}
There is a natural isomorphism $\bc_*(X \du Y) \cong \bc_*(X) \otimes \bc_*(Y)$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Given blob diagrams $b_1$ on $X$ and $b_2$ on $Y$, we can combine them
(putting the $b_1$ blobs before the $b_2$ blobs in the ordering) to get a
blob diagram $(b_1, b_2)$ on $X \du Y$.
Because of the blob reordering relations, all blob diagrams on $X \du Y$ arise this way.
In the other direction, any blob diagram on $X\du Y$ is equal (up to sign)
to one that puts $X$ blobs before $Y$ blobs in the ordering, and so determines
a pair of blob diagrams on $X$ and $Y$.
These two maps are compatible with our sign conventions.
The two maps are inverses of each other.
\nn{should probably say something about sign conventions for the differential
in a tensor product of chain complexes; ask Scott}
\end{proof}

For the next proposition we will temporarily restore $n$-manifold boundary
conditions to the notation.

Suppose that for all $c \in \cC(\bd B^n)$
we have a splitting $s: H_0(\bc_*(B^n, c)) \to \bc_0(B^n; c)$
of the quotient map
$p: \bc_0(B^n; c) \to H_0(\bc_*(B^n, c))$.
For example, this is always the case if the coefficient ring is a field.
Then
\begin{prop} \label{bcontract}
For all $c \in \cC(\bd B^n)$ the natural map $p: \bc_*(B^n, c) \to H_0(\bc_*(B^n, c))$
is a chain homotopy equivalence
with inverse $s: H_0(\bc_*(B^n, c)) \to \bc_*(B^n; c)$.
Here we think of $H_0(\bc_*(B^n, c))$ as a 1-step complex concentrated in degree 0.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
By assumption $p\circ s = \id$, so all that remains is to find a degree 1 map
$h : \bc_*(B^n; c) \to \bc_*(B^n; c)$ such that $\bd h + h\bd = \id - s \circ p$.
For $i \ge 1$, define $h_i : \bc_i(B^n; c) \to \bc_{i+1}(B^n; c)$ by adding
an $(i{+}1)$-st blob equal to all of $B^n$.
In other words, add a new outermost blob which encloses all of the others.
Define $h_0 : \bc_0(B^n; c) \to \bc_1(B^n; c)$ by setting $h_0(x)$ equal to
the 1-blob with blob $B^n$ and label $x - s(p(x)) \in U(B^n; c)$.
\end{proof}

Note that if there is no splitting $s$, we can let $h_0 = 0$ and get a homotopy
equivalence to the 2-step complex $U(B^n; c) \to \cC(B^n; c)$.

For fields based on $n$-categories, $H_0(\bc_*(B^n; c)) \cong \mor(c', c'')$,
where $(c', c'')$ is some (any) splitting of $c$ into domain and range.

\medskip

\nn{Maybe there is no longer a need to repeat the next couple of props here, since we also state them in the introduction.
But I think it's worth saying that the Diff actions will be enhanced later.
Maybe put that in the intro too.}

As we noted above,
\begin{prop}
There is a natural isomorphism $H_0(\bc_*(X)) \cong A(X)$.
\qed
\end{prop}


\begin{prop}
For fixed fields ($n$-cat), $\bc_*$ is a functor from the category
of $n$-manifolds and homeomorphisms to the category of chain complexes and
(chain map) isomorphisms.
\qed
\end{prop}

In particular,
\begin{prop}  \label{diff0prop}
There is an action of $\Homeo(X)$ on $\bc_*(X)$.
\qed
\end{prop}

The above will be greatly strengthened in Section \ref{sec:evaluation}.

\medskip

For the next proposition we will temporarily restore $n$-manifold boundary
conditions to the notation.

Let $X$ be an $n$-manifold, $\bd X = Y \cup (-Y) \cup Z$.
Gluing the two copies of $Y$ together yields an $n$-manifold $X\sgl$
with boundary $Z\sgl$.
Given compatible fields (boundary conditions) $a$, $b$ and $c$ on $Y$, $-Y$ and $Z$,
we have the blob complex $\bc_*(X; a, b, c)$.
If $b = -a$ (the orientation reversal of $a$), then we can glue up blob diagrams on
$X$ to get blob diagrams on $X\sgl$:

\begin{prop}
There is a natural chain map
\eq{
    \gl: \bigoplus_a \bc_*(X; a, -a, c) \to \bc_*(X\sgl; c\sgl).
}
The sum is over all fields $a$ on $Y$ compatible at their
($n{-}2$-dimensional) boundaries with $c$.
`Natural' means natural with respect to the actions of diffeomorphisms.
\qed
\end{prop}

The above map is very far from being an isomorphism, even on homology.
This will be fixed in Section \ref{sec:gluing} below.

%\nn{Next para not needed, since we already use bullet = gluing notation above(?)}

%An instance of gluing we will encounter frequently below is where $X = X_1 \du X_2$
%and $X\sgl = X_1 \cup_Y X_2$.
%(Typically one of $X_1$ or $X_2$ is a disjoint union of balls.)
%For $x_i \in \bc_*(X_i)$, we introduce the notation
%\eq{
%    x_1 \bullet x_2 \deq \gl(x_1 \otimes x_2) .
%}
%Note that we have resumed our habit of omitting boundary labels from the notation.
